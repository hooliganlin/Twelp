Twelp by Bryan Lin

This prototype web application uses the Twitter REST API and GeoCommons API.
It demonstrates the capability to grab Twitter feeds on a selected feature and display
those feeds (if they have geocode), onto the GeoCommons Map.

The current map consists of Yelp data with the DC Health Inspection. Using the Yelp data,
this application can find the surrounding tweets about that particular restaurant. 

NOTE: By default, if there is no geotagged tweets around the surrounding restaurant, 
the Twitter Search REST API will default to the text query. The results will display 
all tweets going back from a week ago about that text query.

The concepts of this application are to display the possible integration of Twitter with
GeoIQ, find the trends of a particular restaurant, and to combine tweets with Yelp reviews.
Having more data and seeing how many followers a restaurant has can justify Yelp's rating.
